Good. This screenshot tells me exactly what’s going on — and also what you’re doing wrong.

The truth (no sugar-coating)

You broke your repo state by editing the same files from multiple places (likely mobile + Codemagic + maybe desktop) without pulling first.
Git is not confused. You are.
The app error (INVALID_STATE) is just a symptom. The real issue is an unfinished merge with conflicts.

Right now:
	•	Your local branch ≠ remote origin/main
	•	A merge started
	•	Conflicts exist
	•	You cannot push, pull, or do anything until this is resolved or aborted

This line is the key:

“Resolve all conflicts to complete merge. You can’t do anything else until the merge has been completed or aborted.”

Git is blocking you on purpose.

⸻

What exactly is conflicting

Two files:
	1.	codemagic.yaml
You edited this multiple times (I can see repeated commits). Codemagic also likely touched it.
	2.	project.pbxproj
This is the Xcode project file.
Brutal truth: editing this from mobile is asking for pain. It changes constantly and merges badly.

⸻

You have ONLY two sane options

Pick one. Don’t improvise.

⸻

OPTION A — You want to KEEP your changes (harder, risky on mobile)

Only do this if you know what Codemagic + Xcode expect.

Steps:
	1.	Tap codemagic.yaml
	•	Resolve conflict manually
	•	Keep ONE clean version
	•	Remove all <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> markers
	2.	Tap project.pbxproj
	•	If you don’t fully understand it: DO NOT GUESS
	•	Best move: accept remote version (origin/main)
	3.	Once both files show no warning icon
	4.	Tap Complete merge and commit
	5.	Then Push

⚠️ If you mess up project.pbxproj, your iOS build will break silently later. That’s on you.

⸻

OPTION B — Abort and reset (recommended, cleaner, faster)

This is the correct move 80% of the time.

Steps:
	1.	Tap Abort merge
	2.	Pull from remote (Pull)
	3.	Let origin/main win
	4.	Re-apply ONLY the changes you actually need
	5.	Commit once
	6.	Push

This avoids corrupting the project file.

⸻

The uncomfortable truth you need to hear
	•	You are trying to manage CI/CD + iOS builds from a phone
	•	That’s fine for viewing
	•	It’s irresponsible for resolving Xcode merge conflicts
	•	You’re burning time fixing avoidable problems instead of shipping

Opportunity cost:
Every hour you fight Git like this is an hour you’re not moving the product forward.

⸻

My direct recommendation (no debate)
	•	Abort the merge
	•	Pull clean
	•	Do Codemagic + Xcode changes from ONE environment (desktop)
	•	Use mobile Git for review only

If you want, next message tell me:
	•	Are you using Xcode locally or Codemagic only
	•	Do you want Codemagic.yaml authoritative or local

I’ll give you a clean, no-conflict workflow and stop this loop permanently.
