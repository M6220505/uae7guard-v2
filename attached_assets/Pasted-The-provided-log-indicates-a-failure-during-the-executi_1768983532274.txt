The provided log indicates a failure during the execution of a Python script (main.py) within a GitHub Actions workflow. Specifically, the error is a FileNotFoundError occurring at line 20 of main.py.
Root Cause Analysis
The script is attempting to open or interact with a file named data.json, but the file does not exist in the working directory of the GitHub runner at the time of execution.
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data.json'

Why this is happening
 * Missing File in Repository: The data.json file might not have been committed to the repository.
 * Relative Path Issues: The script may be looking for the file in the root directory, but it might be located in a subdirectory (e.g., src/data.json).
 * Dynamic Generation Failure: If a previous step in your workflow was supposed to generate this file (e.g., a scraping or build step), that step likely failed or didn't save the file to the expected location.
 * Case Sensitivity: GitHub runners (typically Linux-based) are case-sensitive. If the file is named Data.json but the code calls data.json, it will fail.
Recommended Fixes
1. Verify File Existence
Ensure data.json is actually present in your GitHub repository. If it is a file that is supposed to be generated during the run, check the logs of the preceding steps to see if they completed successfully.
2. Update the Python Script
Modify main.py to handle the missing file gracefully or use absolute paths. You can add a check to see if the file exists before opening it:
import os

file_path = 'data.json'
if not os.path.exists(file_path):
    # Handle the error, e.g., create an empty file or log a specific message
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write('{}') 

3. Check the Workflow Configuration
If the file is in a specific folder, ensure your Python script accounts for that, or change the working directory in your GitHub Actions YAML:
- name: Run script
  run: python main.py
  working-directory: ./path/to/your/folder

4. Debugging via Workflow
To see exactly what files are available to the runner at the time of the crash, add an ls command right before the script execution in your .github/workflows/main.yml:
- name: List files for debugging
  run: ls -R
- name: Run main script
  run: python main.py

This will output the entire directory structure to the logs, allowing you to see exactly where data.json is located (or if it’s missing entirely).
