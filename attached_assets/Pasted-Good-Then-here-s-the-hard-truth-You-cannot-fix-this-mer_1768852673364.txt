Good. Then here’s the hard truth:

You cannot fix this merge on an iPhone. Period.
Not because you’re doing it wrong — because Git + .pbxproj + mobile UI is a dead end.

So we stop pretending otherwise and end this forever using the only viable iPhone-only path.

⸻

The only solution that actually works on iPhone (GitHub-side reset)

You will discard your local broken state and realign everything from the remote.
Your iPhone app is poisoned. We don’t cure poison — we replace the body.

What you’re doing

You will:
	•	Let GitHub be the source of truth
	•	Throw away the local merge state
	•	Re-clone clean

No heroics. No merge. No conflict resolution.

⸻

Step-by-step (iPhone only)

1️⃣ Open GitHub.com in Safari (NOT the app)
	•	Go to your repository
	•	Switch to the main branch

2️⃣ Make sure main is correct

Check:
	•	codemagic.yaml → correct version?
	•	App builds? CI okay?

If yes → continue
If no → fix it directly on GitHub (Edit → Commit to main)

GitHub web editor can safely handle YAML
It cannot break .pbxproj

⸻

3️⃣ Delete the local repo from your iPhone app

This is critical.

In your Git app:
	•	Remove / Delete the repository locally
	•	Do NOT sync
	•	Do NOT retry merge
	•	Do NOT abort merge (it’s already corrupted)

You are cutting off a gangrenous limb.

⸻

4️⃣ Re-clone the repo fresh
	•	Clone from origin/main
	•	Clean state
	•	Zero conflicts
	•	Zero merge
	•	Zero INVALID_STATE

This permanently closes the case.

⸻

Why this works (and nothing else will)
	•	Git merge state lives locally → you can’t repair it on iOS
	•	.pbxproj conflicts require Xcode → impossible on iPhone
	•	Mobile Git apps cannot rebuild index locks correctly
	•	GitHub is clean → your local copy is not

So we nuke local, trust remote, and move on.

⸻

What you lose (be honest with yourself)
	•	Any uncommitted local changes → gone

If you had important work only on the phone:
That was already lost the moment .pbxproj conflicted.
Continuing to fight is denial, not engineering.

⸻

Strategic advice (this is the real lesson)
	•	iPhone = viewer + quick YAML edits
	•	iPhone ≠ Git conflict resolution
	•	iPhone ≠ iOS project management

If you plan to keep shipping iOS apps:
You need one of these:
	•	A Mac (even used)
	•	GitHub Codespaces
	•	Replit + GitHub CI only (no local iOS edits)

Otherwise this will repeat. Guaranteed.

⸻

Bottom line

Delete local repo.
Re-clone clean.
Stop bleeding time.
