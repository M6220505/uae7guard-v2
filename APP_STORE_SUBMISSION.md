## App Store Review Notes

**IMPORTANT: Copy this into the "Notes for Reviewer" field when submitting:**

```
Dear App Review Team,

UAE7Guard is a FREE EDUCATIONAL TOOL for checking cryptocurrency wallet addresses against a community-maintained database of reported scams. 

CLASSIFICATION CLARIFICATION:

This app is NOT:
- A cryptocurrency wallet (we do not store any crypto)
- A cryptocurrency exchange (we do not facilitate any trades)
- A financial advisory service (we provide information only)
- A money transmission service (no money flows through our app)

This app IS:
- An educational reference tool (similar to a virus scanner)
- A community reporting platform (like a fraud reporting website)
- An informational database lookup service

HOW IT WORKS:
1. User enters a wallet address (just text input)
2. App checks our database of community-reported scam addresses
3. App displays a color-coded result (safe/caution/danger)
4. App shows educational content about scam types

NO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS:
- We never ask for private keys
- We never connect to any wallet
- We never process any payments (except optional in-app subscriptions for premium features)
- We never handle, store, or transmit cryptocurrency

REGULATORY STATUS:
As an educational/informational tool that does not handle cryptocurrency or provide financial advice, this app does not fall under cryptocurrency exchange or wallet regulations (including UAE VARA, US FinCEN, or similar bodies).

This is comparable to:
- A phone number spam checker
- A website safety checker
- A fraud awareness educational app

We are happy to provide any additional clarification needed.

Thank you for your review.
