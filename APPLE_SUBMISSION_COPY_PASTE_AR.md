## 8️⃣ App Review Information - Notes

**انسخ هذا بالكامل في حقل "Notes" (ملاحظات للمراجع):**

```
Dear App Review Team,

UAE7Guard is a FREE EDUCATIONAL TOOL for checking cryptocurrency wallet addresses against a community-maintained database of reported scams.

=== DEMO ACCOUNT ===
Email: applereview@uae7guard.com
Password: AppleReview2026

IMPORTANT: Please use this account to test all features including dashboard, wallet verification, and Arabic language support.

=== CLASSIFICATION CLARIFICATION ===

This app is NOT:
• A cryptocurrency wallet (we do not store any crypto)
• A cryptocurrency exchange (we do not facilitate any trades)
• A financial advisory service (we provide information only)
• A money transmission service (no money flows through our app)

This app IS:
• An educational reference tool (similar to a virus scanner)
• A community reporting platform (like a fraud reporting website)
• An informational database lookup service

=== HOW IT WORKS ===
1. User enters a wallet address (just text input)
2. App checks our database of community-reported scam addresses
3. App displays a color-coded result (safe/caution/danger)
4. App shows educational content about scam types

=== TESTING INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Launch the App
- You will see the home screen

Step 2: Sign In with Demo Account
- Tap Login button
- Email: applereview@uae7guard.com
- Password: AppleReview2026

Step 3: Test Wallet Verification
- Enter test address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
- Tap "Check" button
- View color-coded result

Step 4: Test Arabic Language
- Tap the 🌐 globe icon in header
- App switches to Arabic (RTL layout)
- All features work identically in both languages

Step 5: Explore Features
- Dashboard: View reports and analytics
- Learning Center: Educational scam content
- Settings: Language and theme options

=== NO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ===
• We never ask for private keys
• We never connect to any wallet
• We never process any payments (app is 100% free)
• We never handle, store, or transmit cryptocurrency

=== PRIVACY & COMPLIANCE ===
• UAE PDPL compliant
• No personal data collected for searches
• No tracking or analytics beyond essential app functionality
• Privacy policy: https://uae7guard.com/privacy
• Users can create accounts optionally for saving preferences
• Account data: email and encrypted password only

=== REGULATORY STATUS ===
As an educational/informational tool that does not handle cryptocurrency or provide financial advice, this app does not fall under cryptocurrency exchange or wallet regulations (including UAE VARA, US FinCEN, or similar bodies).

This is comparable to:
• A phone number spam checker (TrueCaller)
• A website safety checker (Norton Safe Web)
• A fraud awareness educational app

=== BACKEND API ===
Production Server: https://uae7guard.com
- Provides authentication endpoints
